# Project Guidance

This repository owns the automatic same-application window tiling GNOME Shell
extension and its parameterized installer.

Keep the extension independent from the broader Linux hotkey setup. The
installer must accept the desired GNOME accelerator as an argument, install
idempotently for the target desktop user, and avoid hard-coded checkout paths.

After changing installed behavior, run tests, deploy the extension to the
current machine, and verify GNOME reports it as active.

Activating edited extension code requires reloading GNOME Shell. The
`linux-configuration` skill is the single source of truth for the safe reload
procedure; follow it rather than restating or diverging from it here.

## Clean Installation Compatibility

All repository changes must remain compatible with a clean installation run
through `installation_scripts/install.sh` and this repository's `install.sh`.
Do not rely on packages, files, settings, or manual steps that exist only on
the current machine. Add every required dependency, asset, configuration
step, and migration to the installer so a fresh checkout can reproduce the
complete setup.

Keep installation steps idempotent and verify the clean-install path for every
change.


## Mandatory programming guidelines prompt

Every agent task in this repository must load the shared
`general-programming-guidelines` skill before the first file edit, using the
harness-native invocation for the runtime in use:

- Codex-family (`ca`, `qa`, `oa`, `na`, …): `$general-programming-guidelines`
- Claude Code, Cline, Grok: `/general-programming-guidelines`
- OpenCode: load `general-programming-guidelines` with the skill tool

Agent Command Center prepends this bare invocation to every dispatched prompt, so the
harness activates the skill before reading the task. When you start a task by hand, invoke it
yourself first. Then follow its Work Loop — dedicated worktree branch before
the first edit, tests, logging, documentation — and do not report the task done
until its Definition of Done checklist passes.
Always finish the delivery: commit in the worktree, merge into the default
branch with `git merge --no-ff`, then reload whatever consumes the change
(installer, skill deployment, service, session). You do not need to be asked.
Never push to a remote and never rewrite history unless the user explicitly
requests it.
