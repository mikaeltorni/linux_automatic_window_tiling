# Project Guidance

This repository owns the automatic same-application window tiling GNOME Shell
extension and its parameterized installer.

Keep the extension independent from the broader Linux hotkey setup. The
installer must accept the desired GNOME accelerator as an argument, install
idempotently for the target desktop user, and avoid hard-coded checkout paths.

After changing installed behavior, run tests, deploy the extension to the
current machine, and verify GNOME reports it as active.

Do not run `gnome-shell --replace` automatically. It can disrupt the current
desktop session and leave user extensions globally disabled. Deploy files and
settings safely, then ask for logout/login when a fresh Shell process is
required. Always verify `org.gnome.shell disable-user-extensions` remains
`false` and that previously enabled extensions are still active.

## Clean Installation Compatibility

All repository changes must remain compatible with a clean installation run
through `installation_scripts/install.sh` and this repository's `install.sh`.
Do not rely on packages, files, settings, or manual steps that exist only on
the current machine. Add every required dependency, asset, configuration
step, and migration to the installer so a fresh checkout can reproduce the
complete setup.

Keep installation steps idempotent and verify the clean-install path for every
change.

## Reloading GNOME Shell

When a change needs GNOME Shell to reload (extensions, themes, shell-side
configuration), reload it in place — never log the user out or terminate the
session.

- X11 session: run
  `busctl --user call org.gnome.Shell /org/gnome/Shell org.gnome.Shell Eval s 'Meta.restart("Restarting…")'`
  (equivalent to pressing Alt+F2 → `r`). This restarts gnome-shell while
  preserving the user's open windows and applications.
- Wayland session: there is no in-place reload. Ask the user to log out and
  back in themselves. Do NOT initiate it.

Never use any of the following to force changes through, regardless of session
type:

- `gnome-session-quit` / `--logout` / `--force`
- `loginctl terminate-session …` / `loginctl kill-user …`
- `systemctl --user stop gnome-session*` or similar unit stops
- `pkill -HUP gnome-shell`, `killall gnome-shell`, or any signal that ends the
  shell process on Wayland

Losing the user's open work is a worse outcome than waiting for them to reload
manually.
