# Project Guidance

This repository owns the automatic same-application window tiling GNOME Shell
extension and its parameterized installer.

Keep the extension independent from the broader Linux hotkey setup. The
installer must accept the desired GNOME accelerator as an argument, install
idempotently for the target desktop user, and avoid hard-coded checkout paths.

After changing installed behavior, run tests, deploy the extension to the
current machine, and verify GNOME reports it as active.

Activating edited extension code requires reloading GNOME Shell. The
`linux-configuration` skill is the single source of truth for the safe reload
procedure; follow it rather than restating or diverging from it here.

## Clean Installation Compatibility

All repository changes must remain compatible with a clean installation run
through `installation_scripts/install.sh` and this repository's `install.sh`.
Do not rely on packages, files, settings, or manual steps that exist only on
the current machine. Add every required dependency, asset, configuration
step, and migration to the installer so a fresh checkout can reproduce the
complete setup.

Keep installation steps idempotent and verify the clean-install path for every
change.
